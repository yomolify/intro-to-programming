# Intro to Terminal 



Outside of web surfing, there is often little exploration of the magical abilities of one's computer. The *file system*, which is essentially the collection of files and folders that exist on the computer's *disk* can be accessed by opening the *Finder* in Mac and the *Explorer* in Windows. In the file system we can see the collection of files and folders some of which are required by the system to run, while some are our own documents like pictures, games and other fun stuff ;)

If you are using Windows, it is highly recommended as you start on this beautiful journey of programming, download and install any version of Linux that steals your heart. If you're new to Linux, [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a great introduction to the world of [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) (macOS is also built on a UNIX philosophy). You can run it alongside Windows via a [Dual Boot](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-dual-boot-mode-windows/) setup so you won't lose any access to your current files or operating system. 

Let's open the terminal and explore a new way to access the file system. 

Download & Install Terminal

Open your freshly installed terminal and let's start having some fun!



# Basic Terminal Commands



## `ls`

The ls command - the list command - functions in the [Linux terminal](http://www.informit.com/store/linux-kernel-development-9780672329463) to show all of the major directories filed under a given file system. For example, the command:

`ls /applications`

will show the user all of the folders stored in the overall applications folder.

The `ls` command is used for viewing files, folders and directories.



## `cd`

The `cd` command - change directory - will allow the user to change between file directories. As the name command name suggest, you would use this command to circulate between two different directories. For example, if you wanted to change from the home directory to your mind blowing killer app which lives in the `code` directory, you would input the following command:

`cd code/my_killer_app`

As you might have noted, the path name listed lists in reverse order. Logically `cd code/my_killer_app` reads - change to the `my_killer_app` directory which is stored in the `code` directory. All UNIX commands follow a logical path.



## `mv`

The `mv` command - move - allows a user to move a file to another folder or directory. Just like dragging a file located on a PC desktop to a folder stored within the "Documents" folder, the mv command functions in the same manner. An example of the `mv` command is:

`mv myfile.txt myfiles`

The first part of the command `mv myfile.txt` lists the application to be moved. In this case, `myfile.txt` . The second part of the command `myfiles` lists where `myfile.txt` will be moved to.



## `man`

The `man` command - the manual command - is used to show the manual of the inputted command. Just like a film on the nature of film, the man command is the meta command of the [Linux CLI](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1339466). Inputting the man command will show you all information about the command you are using. An example:

`man cd`

The inputting command will show the manual or all relevant information for the change directory command.



## `mkdir`

The `mkdir` - make directory - command allows the user to make a new directory. Just like making a new directory within a PC or Mac desktop environment, the `mkdir` command makes new directories in a Linux environment. An example of the `mkdir` command

`mkdir nextBigThing`

The example command made the directory "nextBigThing".



## `rmdir`

The `rmdir` - remove directory - command allows the user to remove an existing command using the Linux CLI (Command Line Interface). An example of the rmdir command:

`rmdir stupidApp`

The example command removed the directory "stupidApp".

It should be noted: both the `mkdir` and `rmdir` commands make and remove directories. They do not make files and they will also not remove a directory which has files in it. The mkdir will make an empty directory and the rmdir command will remove an empty directory.



## `touch`

The `touch` command - a.k.a. the make file command - allows users to make files using the CLI. Just as the mkdir command makes directories, the touch command makes files. Just as you would make a .doc or a .txt using a PC desktop, the touch command makes empty files. An example of the touch command:

`touch testfile.txt`

The example touch command effectively created the file testfile.txt. As noted by the extension, the file created is a .txt or text file. To equate, a .txt file in Linux is akin to a .txt notebook file within a Windows or Mac OS.



## `rm`

The `rm` command - remove - like the `rmdir` command is meant to remove files from your Linux OS. Whereas the `rmdir` command will remove directories and files held within, the `rm` command will delete created files. An example of the `rm` command:

`rm testfile.txt`

The aforementioned command removed `testfile.txt`. Interestingly, whereas the `rmdir` command will only delete an empty directory, the `rm` command will remove both files and directories with files in it. This said, the `rm` command carries more weight than the `rmdir` command and should be used with more specificity.



## `locate`

The `locate` - a.k.a. find - command is meant to find a file within the Linux OS. If you don't know the name of a certain file or you aren't sure where the file is saved and stored, the locate command comes in handy. A locate command example:

`locate -i \*red\*house\*city\*`

The stated command will locate a file with the a file name containing "Red", "House" and "City". A note on the input: the use of "-i" tells the system to search for a file unspecific of capitalization (Linux functions in lower case). The use of the asterik "*" signifies searching for a wildcard. A wildcard tells the system to pull any and all files containing the search criteria.

By specifying -i with wildcards, the locate CLI command will pull back all files containing your search criteria effectivley casting the widest search net the system will allow.



## `clear`

The `clear` command does exactly what it says. When your Linux CLI gets all mucked up with various readouts and information, the clear command clears the screen and wipes the board clean. Using the clear command will take the user back to the start prompt of whatever directory you are currently operating in. To use the clear command simply type `clear`.
